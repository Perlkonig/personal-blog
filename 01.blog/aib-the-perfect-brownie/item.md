[Part of the Adventures in Baking (AiB) series.](../adventures-in-baking-aib-overview "Adventures in Baking (AiB): Overview")

Original recipe: <http://cooklikeyourgrandmother.com/2009/07/how-to-make-perfect-brownies/>

Made a pan for before the girls came home, but they were half eaten by the hunters and guides before they could even cool! At least I got *one* piece set aside for each of the kids. I used Hershey’s cocoa powder. There is no way enough batter for a 9×13 pan. The brownies literally melt in your mouth. They’re quite delish, though I’m not sure yet if they’re perfect. We have a Martha Stewart recipe to try and then a Ghiradelli’s box mix to compare against. I’ll report.

Actual yield: More like an 8×8 pan.

Verdict: Keeper.
