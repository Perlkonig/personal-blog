[Part of the Adventures in Baking (AiB) series.](../adventures-in-baking-aib-overview/ "Adventures in Baking (AiB): Overview")

Original recipe: <http://picky-palate.com/2011/03/17/no-bake-chewy-cookies-and-cream-bars/>

[I have made these four times now](../aib-no-bake-chewy-cookies-and-cream-bars "AiB: No-Bake Chewy Cookies and Cream Bars"), and I think I’ve decided what I like best. Because there are seven kids, you have to double it, which gives you a 9×13 pan. We like them a little denser with coarsely crushed Oreos. The best so far is a bag and a half of marshmallows (approx. 675 g) with a half cup of butter and two trays of Oreos (each tray had three rows of 10 cookies each, so a total 60 cookies). For my taste, two bags of marshmallows (approx. 900 g) is a little too much. The bars are much too soft and chewy. No matter what, the kids always love them!

Actual yield: Doubled yields a 9×13 pan.

Verdict: The kids still love them!
