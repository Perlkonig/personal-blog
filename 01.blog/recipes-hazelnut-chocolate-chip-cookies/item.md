Original recipe: <http://gracessweetlife.com/2012/01/hazelnut-cookies-with-chocolate-chunks-biscotti-alle-nocciole-e-cioccolato/>

These are pretty tasty cookies, but theyâ€™re no better than my standby chocolate chip recipe. I do like the hazelnut crunch, though. I measured this recipe by weight instead of volume. (Doubled, I used more like 3 cups of flour instead of 4.) The dough is indeed runnier than other cookies doughs, so it does help to set it up in the fridge for that hour.

Yield: Doubled, using tbsp-sized balls, about 6 dozen (a little more).

Verdict: Perfectly passable cookie, but nothing spectacular.
