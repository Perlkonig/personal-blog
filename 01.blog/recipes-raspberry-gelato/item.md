(yields 2 quarts)

Original Recipe: *Cuisinart® Instruction and Recipe Booklet* for the CIM-60PCC Series

## Ingredients

- 4 cups red raspberries (thawed, if frozen)
- 1 cup sugar
- 2 ¼ cups half-and-half, divided
- 6 large egg yolks
- ¼ cup skim milk powder
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 2 tsp vanilla

## Method

1. Purée the raspberries in a food processor or blender until smooth.
2. Press the mixture through a sieve to remove the seeds and pulp. I ended up with 2 ¼ cups of purée of the most appetizing colour. I wanted to drink it right then and there! Place to the side until later.
3. Place the sugar and about half the half-and-half in a saucepan and bring to a simmer while stirring regularly, making sure the sugar is completely dissolved.
4. Reduce heat to low to keep the mixture warm.
5. Place the egg yolks in a bowl and whisk (with a hand mixer or in a stand mixer) until thick and light in colour (approx. 2 minutes).
6. While still whisking, pour about half of the hot half-and-half/sugar mixture into the eggs and whisk until blended.
7. Pour the egg mixture back in the sauce pan and cook over medium heat in order to pasteurize the eggs. The mixture shouldn’t come to a boil, but it should reach 180°F (82°C) to be safe.
8. Remove from heat and stir in the remaining half-and-half, powdered milk, and heavy cream.
9. Finally, add the raspberry purée and vanilla and mix until incorporated.
10. Cover and chill the custard in the fridge overnight.
11. Freeze the next day according to your ice cream maker’s instructions.

So delicious! I love sorbet, don’t get me wrong, but the combination of the fresh fruit flavour with the creamy custard was just…so…good! Go and make this today!

P.S. I’m sorry I don’t have any pictures! I promise once I get my house/kitchen set up, I’ll be better about at least posting pictures of the final products.
