**Rating:** 3/5

Max Barry, *Jennifer Government* (Vintage, 2004).

This is a futuristic look at a fully capitalistic world where citizens are truly defined by what they do. It’s part political commentary and part crime thriller. It’s well written with well defined characters and some interesting ideas. I will warn you, however, that Max’s characters have no qualms about swearing and some quite profusely so you have been warned. If you enjoy crime fiction, and especially if you like a little political satire thrown in, then I recommend this book.
