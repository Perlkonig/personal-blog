[Part of the Adventures in Baking (AiB) series.](../adventures-in-baking-aib-overview "Adventures in Baking (AiB): Overview")

Original recipe: <http://picky-palate.com/2011/03/17/no-bake-chewy-cookies-and-cream-bars/>

I made this recipe twice to try the different methods. I first did it exactly as the recipe says: in the microwave. The result was more what you see in the picture. It’s a whiter colour with more marshmallow than cookie. I then doubled the recipe (using an entire 454 g bag of marshmallows) and melted them in a saucepan. The result was a much denser and darker mixture with far more cookie. I don’t think it had anything to do with the saucepan vs. microwave method but more with how I doubled the recipe. Both are super delicious. The denser one is richer and the one with more marshmallow tastes more like a rice crispy square but with Oreos.

Since this adventure is all about working from scratch when possible, I didn’t use boxed Oreo crumbs. The box is just the chocolate cookies without the cream and they are very finely crushed. In the Vitamix I can grind them with the cream and coarser.

Actual yield: As written the recipe yields a shallow 8×8 pan of bars.

Verdict: Keeper, of course! The kids enjoyed them.
