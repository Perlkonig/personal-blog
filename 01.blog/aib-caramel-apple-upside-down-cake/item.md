[Part of the Adventures in Baking (AiB) series.](../adventures-in-baking-aib-overview "Adventures in Baking (AiB): Overview")

Original recipe: <http://www.thehazelbloom.com/2010/11/caramel-apple-upside-down-cake-with-cinnamon-whipped-cream/>

Well I broke the cardinal rule and baked something new when company was coming. My heat was a little high when I browned the butter, so part got burned. That meant when the cake was baked and I flipped it, it stuck and tore. It tasted great, though! The cake batter itself tasted delicious. I will definitely try this one again.

Actual yield: N/A

Verdict: Keeper, but I need to try it again.
