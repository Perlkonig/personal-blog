[Part of the Adventures in Baking (AiB) series.](../adventures-in-baking-aib-overview "Adventures in Baking (AiB): Overview")

Original recipe: <http://www.thehazelbloom.com/2011/02/chocolate-banana-marble-muffins/>

Well these are pretty good, but not terrific (and that may very well be my fault). I doubled the recipe, and perhaps I should stop doing that. Doubled, the batter was quite thick. There was no way I could marble the chocolate mixture as it was even stiffer. The first batch I think I undercooked. I cooked the second batch for about 4 minutes longer. We’ll see if they are any better. Don’t get me wrong, they taste fine, but I was hoping for more “wow.” I would definitely add more banana.

Actual yield: Doubled &ndash; 2 dozen muffins

Verdict: Satisfactory. Maybe the batter is more workable if you don’t double the recipe.
