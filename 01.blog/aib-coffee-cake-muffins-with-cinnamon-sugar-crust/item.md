[Part of the Adventures in Baking (AiB) series.](../adventures-in-baking-aib-overview "Adventures in Baking (AiB): Overview")

Original recipe: <http://www.canyoustayfordinner.com/2010/08/02/cinnamon-sugar-crusted-coffee-cake-muffins/>

The original blogger appears to have used some sort of mini muffin pan. I only had cupcake pans. As a result, I didn’t try to encrust the whole thing in cinnamon and sugar&mdash;just the top. It’s not the best coffee cake I’ve ever had, but it is still quite good&mdash;especially fresh, hot, with butter. They only take a few minutes to make, 15 minutes to cook, and were a nice addition to breakfast this morning. (I especially liked the pop of fresh nutmeg.)

Actual yield: Base recipe yields 7 cupcake-sized muffins

Verdict: Keeper.
