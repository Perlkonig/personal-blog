[Part of the Adventures in Baking (AiB) series.](../adventures-in-baking-aib-overview "Adventures in Baking (AiB): Overview")

Original recipe: <http://www.howsweeteats.com/2010/12/chocolate-chip-cookie-dough-dip/>

Yuck! I’m afraid this recipe does not succeed. I don’t like cream cheese much, so I ran it by Adele and Ellen (both big cheesecake fans) and they didn’t like it either. We even let it sit for a couple days, but it didn’t help. Skip this one.

Actual yield: 1 soup bowl of dip

Verdict: No good!
