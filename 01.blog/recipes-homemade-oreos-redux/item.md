When I started my [Adventures in Baking](../adventures-in-baking-aib-overview "Adventures in Baking (AiB): Overview"), [Homemade Oreos](../aib-homemade-oreos "AiB: Homemade Oreos") was one of the first things I made. The girls had a bake sale today, so we made more of these cookies last night. We tripled the dough recipe and doubled the filling recipe. I use 1 tablespoon of dough for each cookie and 1 tablespoon of filling. The recipe yielded 8 dozen individual cookies and enough filling to make 3.5 dozen complete oreos (leaving 1 dozen individual cookies leftover). The only issue was that the filling ended up a little on the sweet side. In the future I’d want to reduce the sugar, but then I’d need to find a way to replace the lost volume.

Anyway, the cookies tasted great!
