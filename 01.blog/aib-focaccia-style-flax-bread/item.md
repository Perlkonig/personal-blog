[Part of the Adventures in Baking (AiB) series.](../adventures-in-baking-aib-overview "Adventures in Baking (AiB): Overview")

Original recipe: <http://lowcarbdiets.about.com/od/breads/r/flaxbasicfoc.htm>

I’ve had a hard time finding low-carb bread recipes, and the flax was the first one I found. I’ve never had flax before. I knew I was in trouble when I opened the bag of flax seed meal. Pew! Nasty! I went ahead and made the bread. Everything worked out as the recipe suggested, but as far as I’m concerned, it’s disgusting. The four-year-old surprised me, though, by asking for more and Adele kinda liked it too, so obviously it’s just a personal preference thing. If you like the taste/smell of flax, then perhaps this bread recipe will float your boat. It sure doesn’t float mine.

Actual yield: One cookie sheet worth of thin focaccia-style bread.

Verdict: I hate it, but other test subjects have liked it. It’s obviously a personal preference issue.
