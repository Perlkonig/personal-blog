This is part of my [podcast series of posts](../podcasts-what-im-listening-to "Podcasts: What I’m Listening To") (the last, if I’m not mistaken). Below is a list of the various podcasts (in alphabetical order) and my thoughts on each of them. The name of the podcast is linked to the feed itself. The “(info)” link will take you to the podcast’s homepage. As for ratings, clearly I like the podcast at least somewhat or I wouldn’t have it on the list at all. So I’m going with a 3-star system. Three stars means I look very forward to the next episode and almost always listen to the entire episode. Two stars are ones I still really enjoy, but I sometimes skip at least parts of the episode, maybe even half. One stars are podcasts that I feel are hit and miss. I will routinely skip sections of the podcast and occasionally skip an entire episode.

This is just a catchall category for stuff that doesn’t fit anywhere. Right now there’s only one podcast here.

Again, let me know if you have any questions, and don’t hesitate to make suggestions for other podcasts I should listen to.

- [Mormon FAIR-Cast](http://www.fairblog.org/feed/podcast) ([info](http://blog.fairmormon.org/mormon-fair-cast/)) - Frequency: at least weekly (sporadic)
- Avg. Duration: anywhere from 10 minutes to 2 hours
- My Rating: 2 stars

I’m a member of the [Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](http://lds.org), and I find frank and academic discussions of religious issues very engaging. I stumbled across this podcast and have enjoyed just about all the episodes. This is not a source of anti-mormon propaganda. It *is* a place where issues of church history are examined frankly and common concerns discussed and placed in a context of faith. If you’re a member of the church, used to be, or are at all interested, give it a listen.
