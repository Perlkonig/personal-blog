So that’s it. Those are the podcasts I’m listening to as of mid-2015. That’s a total of 74 for your listening pleasure. And just to sum everything up, I’m copying & pasting my 22 über favourites into this one post. There’s nothing new here. I just put all the “heart” entries in one place. Enjoy!

The ur-podcast of boardgaming; the granddaddy. If you enjoy boardgaming, then this is the one podcast you need to follow. I discover so many great games through this podcast, and it’s funny to boot. A must for boardgamers.

A hilarious show that reviews cheesy old boardgames. They end every episode with an even funnier “battle of wits” game show. So many laughs! I love this podcast.

This is a video game podcast with occasional discussions of board games. I really like the hosts and their interactions. It’s great when you can find a good combination of humour and serious journalism. Great stuff.

- Frequency: weekly
- Duration: 45 minutes
- Content: occasional very mild language

*Hypothetical Help* is part of the [Frogpants Network](http://frogpants.com/), which contains most of my über favourite podcasts. This is an old podcast that they finally brought back. In it, [Scott Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Johnson_(cartoonist)) and Mark “Turpster” Turpin answer your questions and give (largely questionable) advice. But it’s funny as hell.

**![package_favorite](/images/package_favorite.png) [Lezioni di musica](http://www.radio.rai.it/radio3/podcast/rssradio3.jsp?id=5539) ([info](http://www.radio3.rai.it/dl/radio3/programmi/PublishingBlock-4e02a2ec-4046-486f-b7b2-54b8a5ab86ab.html))**

- **Rating:** 3/3
- Frequency: weekly
- Duration: 30 minutes
- Content: family friendly

RAI’s Radio 3 show about musicology! Each episode takes a particular genre, composer, or piece and gives a solid entry-level lecture, including musical examples. I really love this show. If only there was an English-speaking one I could share!

- **Rating:** 3/3
- Frequency: weekdays

Perhaps my favourite daily podcast. Not only is it hilarious, it has a great format that includes a wide variety of news (including movies, comics, tech, etc.) and great music. Everybody should have this in their ears.

**![package_favorite](/images/package_favorite.png) [Quirks and Quarks](http://www.cbc.ca/podcasting/includes/quirksaio.xml) ([info](http://www.cbc.ca/radio/quirks))**

“Dr. Sydnee McElroy and her husband Justin welcome you to *Sawbones: A Marital Tour of Misguided Medicine*. Every Friday, they dig through the annals of medical history to uncover all the odd, weird, wrong, dumb and just gross ways we’ve tried to fix people over the years. Educational? You bet! Fun? We hope!”

- **Rating:** 3/3

David Plotz, Emily Bazelon, and John Dickerson discuss major political stories of the day. They have great rapport and a good variety of viewpoints.

**![package_favorite](/images/package_favorite.png) [Stop Podcasting Yourself](http://stoppodcastingyourself.libsyn.com/rss) ([info](http://www.maximumfun.org/shows/stop-podcasting-yourself))**

- **Rating:** 3/3

- Content: occasional strong language and adult themes

*SPY* is my favourite weekly podcast. Canadian comedians [Graham Clark](http://grahamclark.com/) and [Dave Shumka](http://t.co/kjtFZOvKZW) interview fellow comedians. More than once I’ve made people on the bus stare because I get myself into a laughing fit. I can’t recommend this one enough.

**![package_favorite](/images/package_favorite.png) [The Therapy Show](http://myextralife.com/ftp/radio/therapy.xml) ([info](http://frogpants.com/podcasts/therapy/))**

- **Rating:** 3/3
- Frequency: weekly (on hiatus)
- Duration: 60 minutes
- Content: family friendly

A regular part of my favourite daily podcast, [The Morning Stream](http://frogpants.com/tms/), is “therapy thursdays” where Scott’s sister (a proper therapist) answers a listener’s question. It was popular enough that they spun off a separate show. There’s only one season so far, but more is coming.

**![package_favorite](/images/package_favorite.png) NPR’s [Wait Wait…Don’t Tell Me!](http://www.npr.org/rss/podcast.php?id=35) ([info](http://www.npr.org/programs/wait-wait-dont-tell-me/))**

NPR’s weekly quiz show about current news and events. I always enjoy it.
