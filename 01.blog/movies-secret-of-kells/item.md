![Secret of Kells](cover-300x300.jpg)

Last night Adele and I watched an animated movie called “The Secret of Kells.” What an awesome film! The animation style is very different and the overall design is fantastic. (I *loved* the wolves!)

The story is an imagination of how the gorgeous [Book of Kells](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Kells) was created. (If you’re not familiar with the book, I actually recommend reading the Wikipedia article before watching the movie.) I was just enthralled from beginning to end. I highly recommend it!

Note: While this is an animated feature, it’s not a kids movie. There are some very scary scenes.
