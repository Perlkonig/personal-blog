Original Recipe: <http://gracessweetlife.com/2012/11/white-chocolate-vanilla-bean-pudding-tarts-easy-halloween-treats/>

Nothing beats the flavour of real vanilla beans! I’ll never go back. Adele is a big white chocolate fan, so I decided to try this pudding recipe. I didn’t bother with the whole tart thing. I just made the pudding. It was awesome, but not quite chocolatey enough. The vanilla flavour was very dominant. Next time I’ll try 8 or even 10 ounces of chocolate. Delicious though!

Yield: About 4 cups of pudding.

Verdict: Keeper! But I’ll be adding more chocolate in the future.
