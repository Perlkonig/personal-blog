Mark Kurlansky, *Salt: A World History* (A. Knopf Canada, 2002).

If you like reading history, then you’ll enjoy the book. It’s well organized and clearly written—very accessible writing style. If history bores you, then the book will bore you. It is just what it says it is, a book on the history of salt production throughout the world. Some very interesting stuff, actually! I did do a bit of skimming, though, when I got to parts that weren’t particularly interesting to me personally.
