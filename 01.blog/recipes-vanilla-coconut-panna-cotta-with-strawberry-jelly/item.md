Original recipes: <http://gracessweetlife.com/2010/12/vanilla-coconut-panna-cotta-with-pomegranate-jelly/> combined with <http://gracessweetlife.com/2011/03/strawberry-shortcake-trifle/>

I didn’t have any pomegranate juice, and I wasn’t in the mood to make an angel food cake, so I combined the two recipes and made the panna cotta with the strawberry jelly. I also didn’t want to fill the fridge with 12 individual desert cups, so I just did a large 9×13 pan. (It has to hold almost 12 cups of liquid!) For the jelly, I doubled the recipe and used a full three packets of gelatine. I didn’t change anything in the panna cotta recipe (except I use 3 tsp Mexican vanilla extract instead of beans). The result was quite delicious, with a really rich coconut flavour. You could just eat the panna cotta without anything else, but I personally liked having the fruit jelly to offset the richness of the coconut. I have to say, I’m quite sold on panna cotta as a principle. It’s much easier than creme brule (which I *still* haven’t been able to make work right).

Yield: Large 9×13 pan (almost 12 cups of liquid total)

Verdict: Delicious! I will definitely be making this again with pomegranate juice once I can get my hands on some.
