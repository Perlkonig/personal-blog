[FallCon](http://fallcon.com/) is an annual boardgaming convention that takes place in Calgary, Alberta, over three days (Friday night, all day Saturday, and Sunday morning/afternoon; 28 hours total). This year was FallCon 31. I haven't been able to attend FallCon for a while, but I'm so happy to be back and don't plan on missing another year, if I can help it. Being the “game guy” in the family, I almost never have opportunities to play games I didn’t purchase myself. So FallCon is a rare opportunity to experience new games first hand.

A huge thank you to the FallCon committee and volunteers for making the convention possible!

===

FallCon offers a number of different experiences:

* The most popular is the open gaming area. Now that they're in the SAIT gymnasium, the open gaming area is enormous. You also have access to their massive game library. You can just check out a game and go find a table. They also have a system for signalling that you're looking for more players or looking for someone to teach you the game.

* They also have "hosted games" where a dedicated host teaches a group of people how to play a game, which you then sit down and play. This is my favourite part. It's an ideal way to learn a new game, and it'sone of the few times I get to try a game before maybe buying it. There are multiple hosted sessions a day, and multiple different games being offered in each session, so you can almost fill up your entire schedule with hosted sessions. You also get to meet lots of different people.

* Prototype corner is a space where game designers bring their unfinished and close-to-finished games for playtesting. It's not really my bag, but a good number of people participate. FallCon hosts the [Canadian Game Design Awards](https://www.fallcon.com/rules.html), which gets awarded at the convention. **TODO** This year it went to blah blah...

* They've also introduced a few panels in recent years, mostly focused on game design. Great if you're into that sort of thing.

* Perhaps the second-most popular aspect of FallCon is the auction (Saturday evening) and flea market (Sunday morning). At the auction you can apparently get some great deals, but unless you're going to buy a bunch of games to quickly fill up your collection, I just don't find it worth my time (the auction can take 3 hours). I'd personally rather be playing games. The flea market is just that. A bunch of tables with people selling games. Again, some great deals to be had, if you're looking.

* And finally they have the vendor tables. Again, not really my thing, but I did discover some more game stores and [a Calgary-based maker of beautiful game tables](http://wheatlandwoodwork.ca/). So that was exciting :)

## Tips and Tricks

If you really want to maximize your play time, go with a buddy. That way when you have an hour or two between hosted games, you can quickly just pick up a game from the library and start playing. I really enjoy playing with new people, but I lost a few hours over the weekend because nobody had open spots at their table.

Do sign up early. It routinely sells out. And if you sign up early, the whole weekend is only US$40. That's an absolute steal!

Do take advantage of the hosted games. You can sign up in the weeks leading up to the convention. It's a great opportunity to play games you know you probably won't ever buy but want to at least try.

## The Games

### Escape Room

[![Exterior of the escape room](escape-room.jpg?cropResize=300,300&classes=caption "Exterior of the escape room")](escape-room.jpg)

For a couple of years now, a group of guys have designed and built an escape room for the convention. I couldn't take a picture inside, but here's a picture from the outside. They put a lot of effort into it, and it included all sorts of electronics, too. Believe it or not, it was my very first time in an actual escape room (though I've done various video game versions), so I can't compare it to anything, but I quite enjoyed myself. It was a steampunk theme, and the puzzles were naturally rooted in various board games. Decipher the clues to get the combinations to open the locks that lead to more clues until you find your way out. This was a great opportunity to try one of these without having to lay out tons of dough.

### Decrypto

Perhaps my new favourite word game! It's like [Codenames](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/178900/codenames) only more competitive and meta.

You divide up into two teams. Each team gets four secret words that they never reveal until the game is over, but everyone on the team knows what they are. Each of those words maps to a number (1 through 4). Then each member of the team takes a turn as the code giver. They pick a card with three numbers on it and then write down three clues that will point their teammates to their secret word that matches the number on the card.

Here's where it gets meta. Every round you give the clues and the final code to the opponents. So as the game progresses, they'll have a list of clues for each of your numbers. At the end of each round, your opponents get a chance to "intercept" your code by trying to successfully guess the three digits on your card. If a team successfully intercepts twice, they immediately win. If your own team guesses wrong twice, then your team loses. Otherwise, the team with the most points at the end of eight rounds wins.

So the trick is to give clues that are obvious enough to your teammates but that are different enough that your opponents can't discern a theme. And it's always interesting at the end of the game to reveal the secret words and see how everybody was thinking.

This is one I'm bringing to our work sessions as soon as it arrives.

### Village

[![Village: Near the end of the game](village.jpg?cropResize=300,300&classes=caption "Village, near the end of the game")](village.jpg)

This was a pick-up game I found to round out my Friday night. It's a worker placement game with a unique time mechanic: your workers die. Your workers are divided into four generations, numbered 1 to 4. When you bring new workers in, you always choose the lowest numbered one you have available. And when you are forced to kill a worker, you do the same thing. (There's nothing special about workers in different generations. It's just a way to implement the time mechanic.)

As in any worker placement game, there are various stations around the board where you can deploy your workers to accomplish various tasks. Tasks usually take some time to complete. Whenever you spend 10 time, you have to kill off one of your oldest workers. If there is room in the town chronicle, then your family member is memorialized there. Otherwise they get buried in the anonymous graveyard. The game ends when either the chronicle or the graveyard is full. Whoever has the most points wins.

I should preface my thoughts by saying I didn't read the rulebook. One of the others taught us. So it's possible that we played things wrong. 

* While I really liked the time mechanic, the individual actions were not at all compelling, and were even nonsensical at times. Like when travelling the countryside, you need to *discard* your wagon. And to move to the next town, you need to build another wagon. But how does that wagon get to you? I did find the church action interesting at least.

* The cubes seems superfluous. They're hard to get early on, but very quickly you seem to have quite the stash and nowhere to spend them.

* This certainly isn't one I plan on adding to my collection, but I'd be willing to read the rules myself and play it again.

### Heaven and Ale

[![Heaven and Ale: Near the end of the game](HeavenAndAle.jpg?cropResize=300,300&classes=caption "Heaven and Ale, near the end of the game")](HeavenAndAle.jpg)

This is medium-weight euro with consistent if thin theme. It was one of the most tense games I played during the con.

The action happens on a central board. Players move around the board collecting various tokens. You can move as far forward as you want, but you can never move backwards. Tokens you collect get placed on your player board and, when triggered, increase your production of various resources. Your final score is a combination of your lowest-producing resource and your brewmaster rating. This means you can't ignore anything. There's also a race element as you approach the end of the game as certain tokens (in particular the purple action tokens) become rarer and rarer, and only two people can claim each of the achievements. 

It's very competitive. If you can't let go of the tension that can build in games like this, then it may not be for you. It's not like drafting games where you can see what the next person needs and choose to not give it to them. There's too much going on. But you all need essentially the same things, so you have to be prepared to adapt when the one thing you need to complete your master plan is invariably taken before you can get there.
