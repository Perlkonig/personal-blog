We’re hosting two sets of holiday dinners this month (one of them vegetarian), and we’re going nontraditional. I’m still scared of killing everybody with a poorly cooked turkey. That means new recipes, which means practice. I have the whole month off, so fortunately I have the time. I’ll share the recipes I finally end up using.

Anyway, [Smitten Kitchen](http://smittenkitchen.com) is a beautiful food blog where I’ve found a number of great recipes. I came across the following two recipes last week and have now had a chance to test them. Both recipes are simple to make, and we loved them both.

## Parsley Pecorino Biscuits

Original recipe: <http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2015/11/parsley-pecorino-biscuits/>

I couldn’t find pecorino cheese at my local grocer, so for the test run I used parmesan. I’ll hit the Italian market and test out the pecorino later. I don’t love that the baking recipes are volume based instead of by weight, but if you’re careful with measuring your flour, things will work out. The trick to good biscuits is to handle the dough as little as possible. When the recipe says “mix until just combined,” they mean it. Don’t overwork it. Also, one way I’ve found for cutting butter into flour is to freeze the butter and then grate it. I didn’t do that this time, but it works well.

These biscuits were divine! They rose really well and were super flaky and tender. I’m definitely using this recipe for our dinners. It’s a delicious savoury biscuit that makes the whole house smell wonderful.

The best promise of the recipe is that you can make the biscuits up, cut them out, and then freeze them. You can apparently bake them straight out of the freezer. That’s awesome! I’ll definitely try this.

## Crisp Rosemary Flatbread

Original recipe: <http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2008/08/crisp-rosemary-flatbread/>

I baked these directly on the stone. Super tasty! I’m interested to see how well it holds up overnight.
