[Part of the Adventures in Baking (AiB) series.](../adventures-in-baking-aib-overview "Adventures in Baking (AiB): Overview")

Original recipe: <http://www.blueeyedbakers.com/home/2010/9/7/millionaires-shortbread.html>

This recipe did not turn out so good. The shortbread is not particularly good. The [butter cookies](../aib-lemon-meringue-custard-with-butter-cookies "AiB: Lemon Meringue Custard with Butter Cookies") I made earlier are far superior. The caramel recipe resulted in essentially toffee. The layer was impossible to cut through without cracking and it was far too hard for my liking. The idea sounds good, but I would use completely different recipes for the different layers. The kids liked it, but they didn’t love it.

Actual yield: One 8×8 pan.

Verdict: I probably won’t make this again. If I do, it will be with different recipes for the various layers.
