As much as I love listening to lots of music, I am completely hooked on podcasts. I listen to something pretty much nonstop. My favourite feature of the podcast app I use, [BeyondPod](http://www.beyondpod.mobi/android/index.htm), is SmartPlay. It lets you automate in a very customizable way how the player goes from episode to episode. This means I have a constant stream of interesting music and talk all day with no manual intervention needed.

Last year I did a series of posts about what I was listening to. Lots has changed, so I thought I’d do another series of posts about what I’m listening to right now. The posts will come out probably every week. Each post will address a particular category and will show you where to go to get more information.

Don’t hesitate to contact me for more information, and I’m absolutely open to suggestions for new podcasts for my playlist.
