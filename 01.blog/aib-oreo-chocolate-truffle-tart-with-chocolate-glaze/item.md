[Part of the Adventures in Baking (AiB) series.](../adventures-in-baking-aib-overview "Adventures in Baking (AiB): Overview")

Original recipe: <http://gracessweetlife.com/2011/04/oreo-chocolate-truffle-tart-with-chocolate-glaze/>

This was delicious! I used a 9&Prime; pie pan because I didn’t have an 8&Prime; tart tin. It’s much faster to make than the [Chocolate Mousse Cake](../aib-chocolate-mousse-cake "AiB: Chocolate Mousse Cake") but still satisfies much of the chocolate craving. It gives a nice smooth texture and rich flavour. It beats plain chocolate cream pie any day.

Actual yield: N/A

Verdict: Keeper!
