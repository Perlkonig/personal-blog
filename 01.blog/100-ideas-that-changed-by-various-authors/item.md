**Rating:** 3/5

I finished these books months ago, but I’m just now getting around to posting about them. This is a series of coffee-table-style books (meaning mostly full-colour photos) that take a discipline and present one author’s take on the 100 ideas that changed that field. There are six books in the series:art, graphic design, photography, film, architecture, and fashion. I wasn’t able to get a hold of the art and photography books.

Overall I enjoyed the books. If you just want a high-level overview of the development of a field, this is a fine place to start. The photos are great (warning, though, that the fashion and film books do contain nudity) and the bibliographies are a good jumping-off point, too.

The typography of all the books really bothered me, though. They used justified columns (which is a good thing) but they made no attempt to smooth out the word spacing. If you are going to justify text, you *must* allow hyphenation and you *will* have to review the layout for awkward spacing. They just seemed to drop the text in and printed the book. This was particularly disturbing/ironic in the graphic design book.

Ultimately, I think I would rank the books as follows, from favourite to least favourite: fashion, film, architecture, and graphic design. Enjoy!
