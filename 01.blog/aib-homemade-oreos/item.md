[Part of the Adventures in Baking (AiB) series.](../adventures-in-baking-aib-overview "Adventures in Baking (AiB): Overview")

Original recipe: <http://flour-child.net/2011/05/12/homemade-oreos/>

Woohoo! They worked and tasted great! Gotta love the buttercream filling!

First the cookies: Nothing unusual here. Note that the dough is very dry and barely holds together. They cooked up great and remained soft. I should also note that the only butter I have on hand is salted, and that’s what I used in all the recipes.

Now for the best part, the filling: I didn’t have any shortening, so I just used margarine instead. The next time I make them (the kids insist I make them again) I will use shortening and let you know if it really does taste different. The filling tasted great and you could easily add food colouring or flavouring (like mint!) for variety. I had lots left over, so go ahead and be generous when filling the cookies.

Actual yield: This recipe yields 15 large cookies. To get 25–30 you’d really need to make them the same size as real Oreos.

Verdict: Keeper! The kids were big fans.
