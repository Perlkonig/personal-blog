Original recipe: <http://gracessweetlife.com/2010/09/chocolate-cheesecake-with-chocolate-sauce-butter-caramel-sauce-and-hazelnuts/>

I really don’t like cheesecake, so I’m sorry my reviews can’t be more detailed. Adele and Ellen tell me it’s a very good cheesecake. I didn’t make the chocolate sauce as I had some leftover ganache from a previous recipe. I made the caramel sauce, but I was not impressed with it. It was fine if used right away, but once it hardened, no amount of microwaving could reconstitute it smoothly. Ellen tells me she has a nice caramel sauce recipe, which I will try later.

Actual yield: 1 9&Prime; cheesecake

Verdict: Very good.
