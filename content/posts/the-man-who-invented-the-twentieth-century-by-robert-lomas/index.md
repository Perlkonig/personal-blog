Robert Lomas, *The Man Who Invented the Twentieth Century: Nikola Tesla, Forgotten Genius of Electricity* (London: Headline, 1999).

This is an excellent non-academic biography (no source notes) of Nikola Tesla. I knew *of* Tesla, but it was nice to read his story from beginning to end. Lomas is obviously sympathetic towards Tesla, but I don’t care what you say, there is no way to spin Tesla’s story in such a way as to redeem Edison, Westinghouse, and JP Morgan. Edison especially was, in the immortal words of Matthew Inman, [a douchebag](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/tesla). This is a short and easy read that I recommend to anyone.
