Original Recipe: <http://dinnerontheweb.wordpress.com/2011/11/26/biscotti-toscana/>

I’ve tried [twice](../recipes-chocolate-hazelnut-biscotti "Recipes: Chocolate Hazelnut Biscotti") [previously](../recipes-christmas-2012-baking-plates "Recipes: Christmas 2012: Baking Plates") to make biscotti, with less-than-ideal results. After my second failed attempt, a colleague sent me a link to her sister’s blog and her biscotti recipe. I finally had time to try it out. Success! I finally got the texture I was expecting. They taste great. There’s still lots to experiment with, but I’m encouraged now that I have a place to start from.

The recipe is volume-based, though, so measure the flour “properly” by spooning it in and leveling. I put a bit too much in and the dough had to be pressed together.

Yield: 2 dozen mini-biscotti

Verdict: Great starting-off point
