Original recipe: <http://ohmysugarhigh.com/chocolate-chip-waffle-cookies-recipe/>

These turned out quite nicely! They firm up but still remain a little chewy. The coconut adds a great flavour, and the waffle texture is a nice change from plain (but still yummy!) chocolate chip cookies. It’s a little bit of extra work—you can only do 4 cookies at a time instead of a dozen, but the final product is worth it.

Actual yield: Doubled—yielded around 4 dozen cookies (I forgot to count)

Verdict: Keeper.
