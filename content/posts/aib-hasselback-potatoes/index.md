Original recipe: <http://blogs.babble.com/family-kitchen/2010/06/16/hasselback-potatoes/>

I made crockpot roast and potatoes tonight. It was also my first attempt at gravy. It didn’t thicken much, but it was tasty. For potatoes I decided to do the hasselback. I just did an olive oil coating on top, a glob of butter, and Italian seasoning. They were quite tasty. They’re a nice change from straight baked potatoes. The kids liked that they could be broken up into discs. I used largish potatoes and they were slightly undercooked after 1 hour. Not inedibly so, though—just firm.

Actual yield: N/A

Verdict: Nice switch from straight baked potatoes. Tasty!
