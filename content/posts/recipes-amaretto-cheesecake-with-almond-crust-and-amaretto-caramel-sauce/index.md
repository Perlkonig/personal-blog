Original Recipe: <http://gracessweetlife.com/2011/05/amaretto-cheesecake-with-almond-crust-and-amaretto-caramel-sauce/>

I had a big container of mascarpone cheese and wanted to do more than just mix it in with whipped cream (which is delicious, too, by the way). I did a search and found this recipe for a mascarpone cheesecake! It still uses some philly, but it’s mostly mascarpone, and it completely changes the flavour and texture. Even I wanted a few bites! It doesn’t have as strong a cheese flavour, and the texture is smoother than a traditional cheesecake. We’re not drinkers, so I used almond extract instead of amaretto for the cheesecake (1/2 tsp extract per 2 tbsp amaretto), and I just used vanilla in the caramel. The cake was a big hit. (Sorry! No pictures this time!)

Yield: 1 9&Prime; cheesecake

Verdict: An excellent (if slightly more expensive) alternative to a traditional cheesecake. If you’re a cheesecake fan, you should try it at least once.
