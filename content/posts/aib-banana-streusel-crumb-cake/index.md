[Part of the Adventures in Baking (AiB) series.](../adventures-in-baking-aib-overview "Adventures in Baking (AiB): Overview")

Original recipe: <http://www.noraisinsonmyparade.com/2011/05/banana-streusal-crumb-cake-make-this.html>

Oh my, this was delicious! So moist! This is a killer recipe. I didnâ€™t have cake flour, so I did the 2 tbsp of corn starch thing. Go and make this right away. You will not regret it.

Actual yield: Doubled, it yielded a nice deep 9&times;13 pan.

Verdict: Keeper!
