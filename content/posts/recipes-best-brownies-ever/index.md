I love, love these brownies! No sooner do we finish a pan, I make another one! This recipe only uses chopped chocolate (no cocoa powder), so the quality of your chocolate is really important. Use the best you can get your hands on. Go make a pan now. You won’t regret it. The following yields a 9×13 pan. Cut it in half for an 8×8 pan.

- 3 sticks butter
- 12 oz. chopped chocolate

Melt together the chocolate and butter and set aside to cool.

- 6 eggs
- 1 cup brown sugar
- 2 cups white sugar
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 tsp vanilla extract

Whisk together the eggs, sugar, salt, and vanilla until smooth. Pour in the melted chocolate and butter and mix thoroughly.

- 1½ cups flour
- (optional) 1–1½ cups goobers (chocolate chips, mint patties, nuts, etc.)

Fold in the flour in three additions (½ a cup at a time). Fold in the goobers, if desired. Don’t overwork the batter. You don’t want too much gluten.

Pour into a pan lined with parchment paper (ideal) and bake in a 350°F oven for about an hour. I usually end up baking it for 65–70 minutes. Bake it until a toothpick comes out dry with a few crumbs.

Best—brownies—ever.

Update (25 Feb 2014): I just made a batch with 70% chocolate and it’s even better!! There’s more than enough sugar in the recipe that the darker chocolate just gives you slightly less sweet brownie with an even richer chocolate flavour. Give it a try!
