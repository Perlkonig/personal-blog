Original recipe: <http://www.joyofbaking.com/StrawberrySorbet.html>

I’ve always assumed sorbet is pretty easy to make, but I never really tried. This recipe worked great! Purée fruit, add some lemon juice, mix with simple syrup, freeze. Couldn’t be easier! I did a batch with 4 pounds of strawberries and 1 pound of Saskatoon berries. De-li-cious.

Actual yield: However much fruit you start with.

Verdict: Keeper!
