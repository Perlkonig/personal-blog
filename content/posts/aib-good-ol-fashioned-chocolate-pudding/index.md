[Part of the Adventures in Baking (AiB) series.](../adventures-in-baking-aib-overview "Adventures in Baking (AiB): Overview")

Original recipe: <http://www.joyofbaking.com/ChocolatePudding.html>

I *love* chocolate pudding! It’s an absolute favourite of mine. I really enjoy [the chocolate mousse I’ve been making](../aib-chocolate-mousse-redux "AiB: Chocolate Mousse Redux"), but it’s really rich. Sometimes you just want that smooth chocolate texture. I finally decided to find a cooked pudding recipe that worked. I decided I couldn’t go far wrong with *Joy of Baking*, so that’s the recipe I went with. Boy, is it delicious! This is my new go-to recipe for a quick chocolate fix. Eat it warm or cold, in a bowl or a pie, it has such a great flavour. Keeper!

Actual yield: About 4 cups.

Verdict: Keeper!!
