Performance reviews and discussions around compensation are part of working in
house. You can’t just unilaterally change your hourly rate. If you want to get
ahead, you need to be able to have uncomfortable conversations and demonstrate
your value. But if you’re anything like me, remembering what you did last week,
let alone last year, can be a real challenge. Enter the “brag doc.”

A “brag doc” is basically a private journal you keep of all your work
accomplishments, including not just major projects you’ve worked on but also
things you’ve learned, challenges you’ve overcome and bridges you’ve built.
Then, when it comes time to sit down with your manager or draft up a
justification for a raise, you have a trove of recorded information to help you
put yourself in the best possible light. I personally keep my “brag docs”
private, but you might also keep separate ones that you share with colleagues, a
mentor or your manager.

You should dedicate time to periodically update your “brag docs.” How often
depends on how much you want to record and how good your memory is. I find
setting aside an hour or two every month is enough for me, but your mileage may
vary. When the time comes, review the list of base work you worked on that
period. Review your calendar for meetings you may have forgotten about. Go
through your “Sent” box and review your Slack/Teams channels to see what types
of conversations you were having. Then decide what to record:

-   If you don’t already have a tracker that records all the base editing work
    you’re doing, then maybe a straight list of each individual project will be
    useful. In my case, we have extensive tracking, so I’m more selective about
    what base work I include. Not all projects are created equal. Some have
    outsized impact or pose unique challenges. Those I include.

-   Did you do anything in your normal editing work that was particularly
    helpful or effective? Maybe you helped an author restructure their document?
    Or you caught a particularly embarrassing error or problem?

-   Definitely record projects that fall outside of your base job description.
    Maybe you advised on an important IT project or are part of some internal
    committee? Did you help someone “on the side of the desk” with important
    work?

-   Did you overcome any particular challenges? How? What were the results?

-   Capture what you learned. Did you take any courses or webinars? Read any
    illuminating books? Have a personal epiphany during an editing project? Did
    you change something as a result of something you learned?

-   Don’t forget relationships. Are you a mentor? Did you have a breakthrough
    with a challenging author? Did you do something concrete to strengthen an
    existing relationship or forge a new one?

“Brag docs” aren’t just for in-house editors or even just for work-related
accomplishments. Even if you don’t have to justify yourself to a boss, keeping a
journal of positive achievements is good for your immediate mental health and
can have unexpected uses down the road. You’re worth it!
