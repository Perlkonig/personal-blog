[Part of the Adventures in Baking (AiB) series.](../adventures-in-baking-aib-overview "Adventures in Baking (AiB): Overview")

Original recipe: <http://www.ledelicieux.com/2011/01/17/korova-cookies/>

My cookies just came out of the oven and they are delicious! This is a great (and incidentally, eggless) double-chocolate cookie recipe. I only have salted butter, so I reduced the salt somewhat. I also used plain table salt. My research says that using fleur de sel as anything other than a finishing touch is wasted. If it’s baked in, table salt or kosher salt is fine. I also used straight chocolate chips instead of more expensive baking chocolate. The recipe has a typo that I read to mean “30g Dutch-processed cocoa powder.” Off to pick up the girls from the bus stop now. Hopefully they’ll like them too! (For the record, they do.)

Actual yield: Base recipe yields 20+ cookies.

Verdict: Keeper.
