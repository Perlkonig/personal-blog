Original Recipe: <http://gracessweetlife.com/2012/01/chocolate-hazelnut-pots-de-creme-pots-de-creme-al-cioccolato/>

Well we tried to make creme brulee, but the recipe we used didn’t set up properly. Once we find the one that works, I’ll let you know. In the meantime, we decided to make these pots de creme (which are essentially chocolate creme brulees). It took twice as long to setup than what the recipe recommended, but  they did finally bake. They were way rich, but still very delicious. They take less work to make than [homemade pudding](../aib-good-ol-fashioned-chocolate-pudding "AiB: Good ol’ fashioned Chocolate Pudding"), but more than a [simple chocolate mousse.](../aib-chocolate-mousse "AiB: Chocolate Mousse")

Yield: Just over 4 cups  (1L) of custard

Verdict: Rich and delicious, but the consensus was that a pudding or mousse would be better (unless, of course, you really love the firmer consistency of a custard).
