This is part of my podcast series of posts. Below is a list of the various podcasts (in alphabetical order) and my thoughts on each of them. The name of the podcast is linked to the feed itself. The “(info)” link will take you to the podcast’s homepage. As for ratings, clearly I like the podcast at least somewhat or I wouldn’t have it on the list at all. So I’m going with a 3-star system. Three stars means I look very forward to the next episode and almost always listen to the entire episode. Two stars are ones I still really enjoy, but I sometimes skip at least parts of the episode, maybe even half. One stars are podcasts that I feel are hit and miss. I will routinely skip sections of the podcast and occasionally skip an entire episode.

Again, let me know if you have any questions, and don’t hesitate to make suggestions for other podcasts I should listen to.

- [Brain Science Podcast](http://brainsciencepodcast.libsyn.com/rss) ([info](http://brainsciencepodcast.com/)) - Frequency: monthly
- Avg. Duration: 1 hour
- My Rating: 2 stars

Dr. Virginia Campbell is a neurologist who discusses issues surrounding brain science. She often has guests. While I can’t stand the theme music, I find the information she presents to be interesting.

- [Everyday Einstein’s Quick and Dirty Tips for Making Sense of Science](http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/xml/einstein.xml) ([info](http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/everyday-einstein)) - Frequency: weekly
- Avg. Duration: < 10 minutes

In this podcast, Lee Falin goes into the science of everyday life as well as presents more complex topics in more approachable language.

- [InDesign Secrets](http://feeds.feedburner.com/IndesignSecrets) ([info](http://indesignsecrets.com/)) - Frequency: semi-monthly
- Avg. Duration: 30 minutes
- My Rating: 2 stars

Obviously this podcast has a very specific audience. If you don’t use InDesign, then you can skip this one. If you do use InDesign, there are a few little gems here.

- [Quirks and Quarks Complete Show from CBC Radio](http://www.cbc.ca/podcasting/includes/quirksaio.xml) ([info](http://www.cbc.ca/quirks/)) - Frequency: weekly
- Avg. Duration: 1 hour
- My Rating: 3 stars

This is the long-running CBC science program. I really enjoy this show. Bob McDonald is a great presenter and interviewer, and they always seem to cover fascinating topics. I highly recommend this podcast to those who want to keep up with current science news.

- [Science Friday Audio Podcast](http://sciencefriday.com/audio/scifriaudio.xml) ([info](http://www.sciencefriday.com/)) - Frequency: weekly
- Avg. Duration: 30–60 minutes
- My Rating: 2 stars

Science Friday is NPR’s science podcast. I don’t find it as engaging or informative as Quirks and Quarks, but it does cover a lot of different topics.

- [StarTalk Radio](http://feeds.soundcloud.com/users/soundcloud:users:38128127/sounds.rss) ([info](http://www.startalkradio.net/)) - Frequency: weekly
- Avg. Duration: < 1 hour
- My Rating: 3 stars

This is the Neil deGrasse Tyson radio show that talks about a vast array of science questions, targeted to lay listeners.

- [This Week in Tech](http://feeds.twit.tv/twit) ([info](http://twit.tv/twit)) - Frequency: weekly
- Avg. Duration: 2 hours
- My Rating: 2 stars

Because I already listen to a boat load of podcasts and am barely able to keep up, I only have time for one tech podcast, so this is the one. It’s longer, and the main host irritates me sometimes, but overall it’s a good summary of the week’s tech news, and John C. Dvorak (a regular guest) makes me laugh.
