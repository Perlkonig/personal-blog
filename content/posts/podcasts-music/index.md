This is part of my [podcast series of posts](../podcasts-what-im-listening-to "Podcasts: What I’m Listening To"). Below is a list of the various podcasts (in alphabetical order) and my thoughts on each of them. The name of the podcast is linked to the feed itself. The “(info)” link will take you to the podcast’s homepage. As for ratings, clearly I like the podcast at least somewhat or I wouldn’t have it on the list at all. So I’m going with a 3-star system. Three stars means I look very forward to the next episode and almost always listen to the entire episode. Two stars are ones I still really enjoy, but I sometimes skip at least parts of the episode, maybe even half. One stars are podcasts that I feel are hit and miss. I will routinely skip sections of the podcast and occasionally skip an entire episode.

The “Music” category is a new one for me. There are only three here. I’m still not sold on this whole category, and I may yet drop them all, but here they are for now. The biggest problem for me is having to take out my phone and skipping songs I’m not interested in. I’m used to a pretty-much-hands-free podcasting experience.

Again, let me know if you have any questions, and don’t hesitate to make suggestions for other podcasts I should listen to.

This is a UK podcast presented by Dave and Caroline. They play a wide variety of music. Quite eclectic.

This podcast is done by Brian Ibbott from the [Frogpants Network’s](http://frogpants.com/) [The Morning Stream](http://frogpants.com/tms/). As the name suggests, he focuses on covers by new and lesser-known artists. The styles vary widly. I tend to enjoy most of it. Definitely give this one a shot if you’re into music.

I actually enjoy working/baking/etc. to dance music (e.g., trance, house, etc.). This is an hour-long DJ’d podcast of (so far) good dance music. It’s only monthly, though, but I’m enjoying it.
