[Part of the Adventures in Baking (AiB) series.](../adventures-in-baking-aib-overview "Adventures in Baking (AiB): Overview")

Original recipe: <http://www.perrysplate.com/2008/02/cinn-bun-cheesecake.html>

I made this two days ago but it just got eaten yesterday. I had a 10&Prime; pan, so I only did two layers instead of three. I used gingersnaps for for the cookie. I hate cheesecake, so I can only go by what Adele and Ellen have said&mdash;namely, “Yum!” They really liked it. It certainly looks delicious! This appears to be a good recipe.

Actual yield: N/A

Verdict: Keeper.
