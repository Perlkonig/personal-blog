Original recipe: <http://gracessweetlife.com/2013/04/neapolitan-mousse-cakes/>

Tasty! I love strawberries, so the idea of a strawberry mousse was too much not to try. I don’t have 3-inch ring molds, so I decided to make a single large cake. I did some math and thought a 9-inch springform would be enough, but not quite. Next time I’ll use my 10-inch pan; I’m confident it will contain it all. I didn’t bother with the ganache topping this time. We had lots of homemade chocolate sauce set aside for ice cream.

The mousses are delicious. We didn’t love the cake, though. It was good; it just wasn’t quite perfect. I think I’ll have an opportunity to make two for some birthdays. If so, I’ll use a single [torta caprese](../recipes-torta-caprese-flour-less-chocolate-cake "Recipes: Torta Caprese (Flour-less chocolate cake)") recipe divided between the two pans. Or I’ll experiment with some different chocolate cakes.

It’s not difficult to make, and it’s less rich than the similar [chocolate mousse cake](../aib-chocolate-mousse-cake "AiB: Chocolate Mousse Cake") recipe I’ve made before. Give it a try! You won’t regret it.
