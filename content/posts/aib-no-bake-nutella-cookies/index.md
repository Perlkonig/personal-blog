Original recipe: <http://gingerbreadbagels.com/2011/01/28/no-bake-nutella-cookies-2/>

Delicious! I didn’t have a cookie scoop, so I had to use an ice cream scoop instead. Mine didn’t flatten like the pictures show, and they’re a little brittle. I think smaller cookies would help with that. Regardless, they taste great! We’ll see what the kids think when they get home, though I can’t imagine them not liking them.

Actual yield: Doubled recipe yielded 50ish ice cream scoop sized cookies.

Verdict: Keeper!
