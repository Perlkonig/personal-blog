[Part of the Adventures in Baking (AiB) series.](http://perlkonig.com/2011/09/14/adventures-in-baking-aib-overview/ "Adventures in Baking (AiB): Overview")

[This is the second time I have made butter cookies.](../aib-lemon-meringue-custard-with-butter-cookies "AiB: Lemon Meringue Custard with Butter Cookies") Because I have used so much butter lately, and I was making three different recipes with butter today, I thought I’d use margarine and see how it went. Well they still taste great, but the texture is completely different. I know many of you will roll your eyes and say “I could have told you that,” but don’t make these unless you’re going to use real butter.

This time ’round I got just shy of 3 dozen cookies. Oh, and yes, I dipped them in chocolate again, too.
