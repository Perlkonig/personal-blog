Original recipe: <http://www.sprinklebakes.com/2011/05/lemon-meringue-custards-with-butter.html>

So this is actually two complementary recipes. I made them yesterday. First the custard: Crap! It didn’t look anything like the picture. It was only the faintest yellow, and while it had a lemon flavour, it didn’t taste anything like lemon meringue pie. The recipe made hardly any, too! I doubled the recipe and still only got 6 1/2–3/4 cup servings. Skip this recipe. (It is possible I simply screwed something up, so if you try it and it works great, please let me know!)

The cookies, though—NUM! This is a great shortbread recipe. Next step, to dip them in chocolate! Delicious!!!

Actual yield: Custard—doubled recipe yielded 6 1/2-cup servings. Cookies—doubled recipe yielded 40ish large cookies.

Verdict: Custard is crap, cookies are the bomb!
