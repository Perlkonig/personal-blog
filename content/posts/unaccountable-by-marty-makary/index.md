Marty Makary, MD, *Unaccountable: What Hospitals Won’t Tell You and How Transparency Can Revolutionize Health Care* (New York: Bloomsbury Press, 2012).

A vital issue, harrowing stories, and reasonable solutions.

The problem is the corporatization of health care and the lack of incentives to improve health care. The stories he shares of medical mistakes and issues are scary, to say the least. The answer he proposes is complete transparency of outcome data. Once consumers can make informed decisions, the market can go to work weeding out dangerous hospitals and rewarding good ones. Seems reasonable enough.
