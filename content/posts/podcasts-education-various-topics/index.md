This is part of my [2015 series on podcasts I’m currently listening to](../podcasts-what-im-listening-to-2015). This post lists educational podcasts that discuss all sorts of different podcasts, so don’t belong in any specific category.

The list is in alphabetical order. The name of the podcast is linked to the feed itself (what you’d copy and paste into your podcast app). The “(info)” link will take you to the podcast’s homepage, where available. The “content” field tries to give you an idea what to expect as to language or disturbing content. As for ratings, clearly I like the podcast at least somewhat or I wouldn’t have it on the list at all, so I’m going with a 3-star system.

- Three stars means I look very forward to the next episode and almost always listen to the entire episode.
- Two stars are ones I still really enjoy, but I sometimes skip at least parts of the episode, maybe even half.
- One stars are podcasts that I feel are hit and miss. I will routinely skip sections of the podcast and occasionally skip an entire episode.
- Podcasts marked with the ![package_favorite](/images/package_favorite.png) icon are über favourites. These are the ones I think just about everybody should listen to.

Again, let me know if you have any questions, and don’t hesitate to make suggestions for other podcasts I should listen to.

From bones to sexism, from heroin to “kids who kill,” this podcast talks about just about everything. Lots of laughs.

A BBC Radio 4 show that examines numbers and statistics in the news. Always fascinating.

Another long-running show that talks about all sorts of topics. I skip the occasional episode, but they do a great job.
