[Part of the Adventures in Baking (AiB) series.](../adventures-in-baking-aib-overview "Adventures in Baking (AiB): Overview")

Original recipe: <http://lacasadesweets.com/blog/2011/04/25/crunchy-nutella-brownies/>

The recipe calls for a 9×13 pan. There is no way this makes enough batter for a pan that big. An 8×8 pan is more than sufficient. I lined my pan with foil because the recipe called for it. I hate working with foil and I won’t again. Nothing in the recipe explains why foil is necessary. I think you could just grease the bottom of the pan. Because of the foil mess, I took the brownies out too soon. They ended up more like soft fudge. They still taste good, but the next time I make them I’ll use an 8×8 pan with no liner. I would have preferred that they set like they did in the original picture. Hopefully I’ll accomplish that next time

Actual yield: One 8×8 pan.

Verdict: The recipe is essentially sound. I’m going to make them again and I think they’ll be even better. The frosting is awesome!
