## What Is Plain Language? Part 5: The Nitty-Gritty

*This is the fifth and last in [a series of articles discussing the basic principles of plain language](https://blog.editors.ca/?tag=plain-language) by
Aaron Dalton.*

I offer two half-day workshops: the first is all about the *why* and then we
look at some document-level issues like tone. This is the workshop that I am
most passionate about and try to get in front of as many employees as I can. The
more mechanical parts that I am going to summarize here are relegated to a
second workshop that is still useful and valuable but is not where I want
authors to spend too much energy. This is because the editor can fix many
sentence-level issues with minimal intervention from the writer. But what the
editor *can’t* do is actually write the document.

By the time a document comes to me, there is limited time, and the project team
— who may have been working on the document for many months — has limited energy
for back-and-forths. I have to balance many competing interests ([see my earlier blog post on this problem](https://blog.editors.ca/?p=9413)). So what I want
authors to spend the most energy doing is drafting the document with empathy. I
like to call my teaching efforts "proactive editing."

But there is an interest in the finer-level mechanics, so I’m happy to teach
them. These won’t be new to my fellow editors, and you can find a great deal of
material online about any one of them, so I will simply summarize here.

### Structure

-   **Get to the point:** Make your document title explicit and use the
    "[inverted
    pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_pyramid_(journalism))"
    approach as much as reasonable for the document as a whole and for each
    individual section.

-   **Use descriptive headings:** Your table of contents should tell a story.
    Prefer headings that describe content, not function (e.g., choose "Issues
    with Pipeline Right-of-Way" over "Problem Definition").

-   **Use topic sentences:** Each paragraph should have a specific point to
    make—a purpose. That purpose should be made clear within the first three
    sentences.

### Sentences

-   Prefer shorter sentences.

-   Keep subject and verb close together.

-   Minimize the [passivevoice](http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~gpullum/passive_loathing.html).

-   Minimize negative phrases.

### Words

-   Minimize jargon.

-   Prefer shorter words.

-   Avoid noun strings (e.g., mineral surface lease renewal application form
    guide).

-   The main action of the sentence should be expressed in the verb. This will
    naturally eliminate unnecessary nominalizations and lead to using stronger
    verbs.
