It has been a while since I’ve posted. I’ve had a couple people ask for my most recent recipes. Here they are. All recipes are adapted from [Gisslen’s book *Professional Baking*](../professional-baking-by-wayne-gisslen "“Professional Baking” by Wayne Gisslen"). No photos, I’m afraid!

### 100% Whole Wheat Bread

This is the most moist and delicious whole wheat bread I’ve ever tasted. It makes enough for two large 9×5 loaves. The secret to soft whole wheat bread is enough water and powdered milk.

- Water: 515 g (69%)
- Yeast, fresh: 22 g (3%)
- Whole wheat flour: 750 g (100%)
- Sugar: 15 g (2%)
- Malt syrup: 15 g (2%)
- Powdered milk: 22 g (3%)
- Shortening: 30 g (4%)
- Salt: 15 g (2%)

Straight dough method. Mix until developed (8 minutes in my KitchenAid at second speed) then let rise 90 minutes at 80F (27C). Make up and let double. Bake at 400F until golden brown (approx. 20 minutes).

### Soft Rolls (Hamburger Buns)

I use this recipe to make my hamburger buns. They are super soft and stay delicious for a good 5 days. We love these rolls.

- Water: 375 g (60%)
- Yeast, fresh: 22 g (3.5%)
- Bread flour: 625 g (100%)
- Salt: 12 g (2%)
- Sugar: 60 g (9.5%)
- Powdered milk: 30 g (4.75%)
- Shortening: 30 g (4.75%)
- Butter: 30 g (4.75%)

Straight dough method. Mix until developed (10–12 minutes on my KitchenAid at second speed) then let rise for 90 minutes at 80F (27C). Scale into 100 g units and form into balls. Let rise then bake at 400F until golden brown (approx. 12 minutes).

### Scones

So good! Put whatever you want in them! I usually cut this recipe in half. As written, it makes like 4 dozen scones or so.

- Bread flour: 600 g (50%)
- Pastry flour: 600 g (50%)
- Sugar: 150 g (12.5%)
- Salt: 12 g (1%)
- Baking Powder: 72 g (6%)
- Shortening and/or butter: 480 g (40%)
- Eggs: 180 g (15%)
- Milk: 540 g (45%)
- (optional) Goobies: 300 g (25%) [This includes shredded cheese, chocolate chunks, berries, etc.]

Prepare using biscuit method:

1. Sift together dry ingredients.
2. Cut in the fat.
3. Combine the wet ingredients together then add to the dry.
4. Mix until just combined. Do not overmix!
5. Gently knead to the right consistency.

Scale to units of about 1 pound (450 g) and flatten to a disc about a half-inch thick. Cut into 8 wedges. (You can of course also cut with a biscuit cutter or in any shape you want.) Wash with egg then back at 400F until golden brown and fragrant (about 15 to 20 minutes).
