As you may or may not know, Adele and I are currently travelling. We moved into a storage unit and hit the road. Our first stop has been a family memberâ€™s hunting resort in Vanderhoof, BC, to take care of their seven daughters while the parents are off in the bush for two months. (<shamelessPlug>[Interested in black bear or moose hunting? Come to Crystal Lake Resort!](http://crystallakebc.com)</shamelessPlug>) On the surface it sounds positively insane, but it is actually an almost illegal amount of fun. Since six of the seven girls are in school, I have a little bit of spare time during the day (between the intermittent maulings and interrogations by the cherubic four year old).

This year I decided to try my hand at some baking. The irony if taking up baking while trying to shift my diet to low carb is not lost on me. It just seemed like too good an opportunity to pass up. The mom has all the equipment I need and the expertise to help me figure things out when I need a substitution or something. I also have seven willing test subjects! I assembled a sizable number of recipes that seemed doable and delicious and committed to trying as many of them as possible over the two months I am here. I am happy to report that I have succeeded thus far. The Adventures in Baking (AiB) series will outline the recipes I tried and their results. Unfortunately I was not smart enough to take pictures of my creations. You will have to rely on the pictures from the original recipe sites. If something goes horribly wrong or looks very different, I will be sure to let you know. I hope you will find some of these recipes interesting. If *I* can do it, *anybody* can!
