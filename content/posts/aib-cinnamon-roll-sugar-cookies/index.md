Original recipe: <http://picky-palate.com/2010/02/11/cinnamon-roll-sugar-cookies-yes/>

These cookies turned out awesome! Even hours later, chilled, they are soft and delicious. The kids love them. They really do taste like little cinnamon buns! There wasnâ€™t nearly enough icing, though. Depending on how much you like on the cookies, you could almost double the icing recipe. The cookies are a little fiddly to prepare, but they are really worth it. Num!

Actual yield: Approximately 6 dozen cookies.

Verdict: Delicious! Keeper!
