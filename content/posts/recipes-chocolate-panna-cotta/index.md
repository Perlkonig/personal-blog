Original recipe: <http://gracessweetlife.com/2011/05/milk-chocolate-panna-cotta-with-port-cherry-sauce/>

This was my first panna cotta. I didn’t have milk chocolate, so I had to use bittersweet with some added sugar (1/3 cup instead of 1/4 cup). Ultimately, it would taste much better with milk chocolate. It still tasted good, don’t get me wrong, but it was a very rich chocolate flavour. Fortunately, Adele and Ellen really like dark chocolate. It was a little rich for me. The texture was a little grainy, too. I’m not sure yet whether that was a technique issue or a chocolate issue.

Yield: 8 7-oz ramekins

Verdict: I need to try this with straight milk chocolate. I also have some other panna cotta recipes I’m going to try.

**EDITED TO ADD:** I did finally try this with milk chocolate and it was excellent. It set up perfectly, had a nice creamy texture, and had a light chocolate flavour. This is an excellent lighter alternative to a much richer chocolate mousse or homemade pudding.
