Original Recipe: <http://www.joyofbaking.com/ButterTarts.html>

Adele loves pecan butter tarts, so I finally set out to find a recipe. This one is easy to make, and using a muffin tin is a great way to do these if you don’t have tart tins.

I’ve made this recipe twice now. The first time I did mini-tarts, and the second time I made a single 9-inch tart. In both cases I just put some chopped pecans in the bottom of the tart before filling.

Yield: 10 mini-tarts or 1 nine-inch tart.

Verdict: Adele really enjoyed the filling. It’s apparently not quite perfect, so I’ll keep trying new recipes until Adele says I’ve found “the one.” It is a good base recipe, though.
