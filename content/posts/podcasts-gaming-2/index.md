This is part of my [2015 series on podcasts I’m currently listening to](../podcasts-what-im-listening-to-2015). This post lists podcasts about my favourite pastime: gaming. There are tons of great boardgaming podcasts that I just don’t have time to listen to. To find more boardgaming podcasts that I don’t list here, the best place to start is the [Dice Tower Network](http://www.dicetower.com/dice-tower-network).

The list is in alphabetical order. The name of the podcast is linked to the feed itself (what you’d copy and paste into your podcast app). The “(info)” link will take you to the podcast’s homepage, where available. The “content” field tries to give you an idea what to expect as to language or disturbing content. As for ratings, clearly I like the podcast at least somewhat or I wouldn’t have it on the list at all, so I’m going with a 3-star system.

- Three stars means I look very forward to the next episode and almost always listen to the entire episode.
- Two stars are ones I still really enjoy, but I sometimes skip at least parts of the episode, maybe even half.
- One stars are podcasts that I feel are hit and miss. I will routinely skip sections of the podcast and occasionally skip an entire episode.
- Podcasts marked with the ![package_favorite](/images/package_favorite.png) icon are über favourites. These are the ones I think just about everybody should listen to.

Again, let me know if you have any questions, and don’t hesitate to make suggestions for other podcasts I should listen to.

A hilarious show that reviews cheesy old boardgames. They end every episode with an even funnier “battle of wits” game show. So many laughs! I love this podcast.

**![package_favorite](/images/package_favorite.png) [Gamers With Jobs Conference Call](http://www.gamerswithjobs.com/taxonomy/term/408/0/feed) ([info](http://www.gamerswithjobs.com/))**

- **Rating:** 3/3

This is a video game podcast with occasional discussions of board games. I really like the hosts and their interactions. It’s great when you can find a good combination of humour and serious journalism. Great stuff.

**[Ludology](http://ludology.libsyn.com/rss) ([info](http://www.ludology.libsyn.com/))**

- **Rating:** 3/3 
- Frequency: weekly
- Duration: 60 minutes (full episodes); 5–10 minutes (GameTek episodes)
- Content: family friendly

As its name suggests, this is a scientific look at board games. How do they work? What are the maths behind certain mechanics? It also discusses game design.

- **Rating:** 1/3 
- Frequency: 1–2 weeks
- Duration: 60–90 minutes
- Content: family friendly

This is a podcast put out by a game company itself: Plaid Hat Games. Their interest to me is hit and miss, but I really love the podcasters themselves, and whenever I tune in I have lots of fun. They don’t *just* talk about their own games. They also talk about games they’re playing and field questions about game design and the board game business.

- **Rating:** 1.5/3
- Frequency: 1–2 weeks

- Content: occasional mild language

This super-long podcast talks about boardgaming and RPGs. I routinely skip the second half about RPG topics.

**[The Spiel](http://thespiel.net/feed.xml) ([info](http://thespiel.net/))**

- **Rating:** 1/3 
- Frequency: monthly
- Duration: 2–3 hours
- Content: family friendly

This show explores a handful of games in great depth. Their *Spiel des Jahres* episodes are great.
