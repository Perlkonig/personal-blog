[Smitten Kitchen](http://smittenkitchen.com) is a very attractive and long-standing food blog. I haven’t been able to make any of her more complicated recipes, but I have quite the list of things I want to try.

Adele and I love lemonade, and when I saw this idea I had to make it. I know summer is over (this is something ideal for a really hot day), but it could also make for something a little different at a dinner party. Even my two-year-old nephew, Tavio, loves it. Give it a shot!

Original recipe: <http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2014/09/cucumber-lemonade/>

Essentially it’s 1 cup cucumber juice, 1 cup lemon juice, and 1/3 cups (or so) sugar.
