This is part of my [2015 series on podcasts I’m currently listening to](../podcasts-what-im-listening-to-2015). This post talks about podcasts that tell stories.

The list is in alphabetical order. The name of the podcast is linked to the feed itself (what you’d copy and paste into your podcast app). The “(info)” link will take you to the podcast’s homepage, where available. The “content” field tries to give you an idea what to expect as to language or disturbing content. As for ratings, clearly I like the podcast at least somewhat or I wouldn’t have it on the list at all, so I’m going with a 3-star system.

- Three stars means I look very forward to the next episode and almost always listen to the entire episode.
- Two stars are ones I still really enjoy, but I sometimes skip at least parts of the episode, maybe even half.
- One stars are podcasts that I feel are hit and miss. I will routinely skip sections of the podcast and occasionally skip an entire episode.
- Podcasts marked with the ![package_favorite](/images/package_favorite.png) icon are über favourites. These are the ones I think just about everybody should listen to.

Again, let me know if you have any questions, and don’t hesitate to make suggestions for other podcasts I should listen to.

**[99% Invisible](http://feeds.99percentinvisible.org/99percentinvisible) ([info](http://99percentinvisible.org/))**

- **Rating:** 2/3
- Frequency: weekly
- Duration: 30 minutes
- Content: very occasional mild language or disturbing stories

A show about design and architecture. Somewhat hit and miss for me, but overall really enjoyable.

**[Fugitive Waves](http://feeds.fugitivewaves.org/fugitivewaves) ([info](http://www.kitchensisters.org/fugitivewaves/))**

- **Rating:** 2/3 (provisional)
- Frequency: every two weeks
- Duration: 30–45 minutes
- Content: family friendly (so far)

New podcast for me. They describe it as “Lost recordings and shards of sound, along with new tales from remarkable people around the world — people with a mission, a purpose, a story to tell. Stories from the flip side of history.” I’ve liked what I’ve heard so far.

**NPR’s [Invisibila](http://www.npr.org/rss/podcast.php?id=510307) ([info](http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510307/invisibilia))**

- **Rating:** 3/3
- Frequency: weekly (currently on hiatus)
- Duration: 60 minutes
- Content: no explicit language, but some material can be disturbing

Some really interesting stories. They describe it as follows: “Invisibilia (Latin for all the invisible things) is about the invisible forces that control human behavior – ideas, beliefs, assumptions and emotions.”

**[The Moment](http://feeds.feedburner.com/the-moment) ([info](http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/the_moment.html))**

- **Rating:** 1/3
- Frequency: weekly
- Duration: 60 minutes
- Content: occasional strong language (depending on interviewee)

Interviews with all sorts of successful people, focusing on the defining “moments” of their lives and careers.

**[Mystery Show](http://feeds.gimletmedia.com/mysteryshow) ([info](http://gimletmedia.com/show/mystery-show/))**

- **Rating:** 3/3 (provisional)
- Frequency: variable
- Duration: 45–50 minutes
- Content: family friendly (so far)

Brand new podcast in which Starlee Kine tries to solve mysteries you can’t just solve through Google. While the three episodes so far haven’t “paid off” as big as I would have liked at the end, there are some fascinating moments along the way. I’m excited to see where this goes.

**![package_favorite](/images/package_favorite.png) ****[WNYC’s Radiolab](http://feeds.wnyc.org/radiolab) ([info](http://www.radiolab.org/))**

- **Rating:** 3/3
- Frequency: roughly twice a month
- Duration: 30 minutes
- Content: no explicit language, but some material can be disturbing

Incredible podcast. Pretty much every episode is powerful and tells a fascinating story. Everyone should listen.
