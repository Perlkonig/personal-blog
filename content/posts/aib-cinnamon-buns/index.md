[Part of the Adventures in Baking (AiB) series.](../adventures-in-baking-aib-overview "Adventures in Baking (AiB): Overview")

Original recipe: <http://sorumblyinmytumbly.blogspot.com/2011/05/clone-of-cinnabon.html>

This recipe yields a dough that’s a little hard. I’ll go easier on the flour next time. They still worked out OK and tasted great. The frosting was delish. Next time I’m going to add a splash of lemon.

Actual yield: 12 buns

Verdict: Keeper (but needs a little work)
