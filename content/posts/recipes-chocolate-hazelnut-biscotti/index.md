Original Recipe: <http://www.joyofbaking.com/biscotti/ChocolateHazelnutBiscotti.html>

Well, you really should have a stand mixer to get the dough the right consistency. I also didn’t flatten my logs enough, so they didn’t cook all the way through. The final product was bitter, but I think that’s because of the nuts. I may have over-toasted them. I’m going to try the recipe again once I can get my stand mixer out, and I’ll report back. They weren’t awful, but they weren’t delicious either.

Yield: 20 cookies

Verdict: The jury’s still out
