This is part of my [2015 series on podcasts I’m currently listening to](../podcasts-what-im-listening-to-2015). This post talks about comedy podcasts. There is some crossover with the “general talk” category, but these are podcasts whose main intent is comedy. Some of my favourite podcasts appear here.

The list is in alphabetical order. The name of the podcast is linked to the feed itself (what you’d copy and paste into your podcast app). The “(info)” link will take you to the podcast’s homepage, where available. The “content” field tries to give you an idea what to expect as to language or disturbing content. As for ratings, clearly I like the podcast at least somewhat or I wouldn’t have it on the list at all, so I’m going with a 3-star system.

- Three stars means I look very forward to the next episode and almost always listen to the entire episode.
- Two stars are ones I still really enjoy, but I sometimes skip at least parts of the episode, maybe even half.
- One stars are podcasts that I feel are hit and miss. I will routinely skip sections of the podcast and occasionally skip an entire episode.
- Podcasts marked with the ![package_favorite](/images/package_favorite.png) icon are über favourites. These are the ones I think just about everybody should listen to. (Yes, I know there are a lot of them in this category.)

Again, let me know if you have any questions, and don’t hesitate to make suggestions for other podcasts I should listen to.

**![package_favorite](/images/package_favorite.png) [The Bugle](http://feeds.feedburner.com/thebuglefeed) ([info](http://thebuglepodcast.com/))**

- **Rating:** 3/3 
- Frequency: weekly
- Duration: 60 minutes
- Content: frequent strong language (bleeped)

In *The Bugle*, comedians [John Oliver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Oliver_(comedian)) and [Andy Zaltzman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Zaltzman) riff on current events.

**![package_favorite](/images/package_favorite.png) [Hypothetical Help](http://feeds.frogpants.com/hypohelp_feed.xml) ([info](http://frogpants.com/podcasts/hypothetical-help/))**

- **Rating:** 3/3 
- Frequency: weekly
- Duration: 45 minutes
- Content: occasional very mild language

*Hypothetical Help* is part of the [Frogpants Network](http://frogpants.com/), which contains most of my über favourite podcasts. This is an old podcast that they finally brought back. In it, [Scott Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Johnson_(cartoonist)) and Mark “Turpster” Turpin answer your questions and give (largely questionable) advice. But it’s funny as hell.

**[The Late Show Podcast (w/ Stephen Colbert)](http://feed.theplatform.com/f/kYEXFC/zVfDzVbQRltO)**

- **Rating:** 2/3 
- Frequency: weekly
- Duration: 20 minutes
- Content: family friendly

Adele and I were huge *Colbert Report* fans. We’re excited to see what he does with the *Late Show*—time will tell. He has launched a “behind the scenes” podcast. It’s only two episodes in, so I’m reserving judgement.

**![package_favorite](/images/package_favorite.png) [The Morning Stream](http://myextralife.com/ftp/radio/morningstream.xml) ([info](http://frogpants.com/tms/))**

- **Rating:** 3/3 
- Frequency: weekdays
- Duration: 90 minutes
- Content: occasional very mild language, discussions of news events can include adult topics

Perhaps my favourite daily podcast. Not only is it hilarious, it has a great format that includes a wide variety of news (including movies, comics, tech, etc.) and great music. Everybody should have this in their ears.

**[My Brother, My Brother And Me](http://mbmbam.libsyn.com/rss) ([info](http://www.maximumfun.org/shows/my-brother-my-brother-and-me))**

- **Rating:** 2/3 
- Frequency: weekly
- Duration: 60 minutes
- Content: pervasive strong language and adult themes

*MBMBAM* consists three brothers (Justin, Travis, and Griffin McElroy) answering questions from audience members and riffing on Yahoo! Answers questions. They use explicit language liberally (and some of their sponsors are adult themed), but the material is indeed hilarious.

**![package_favorite](/images/package_favorite.png) [Stop Podcasting Yourself](http://stoppodcastingyourself.libsyn.com/rss) ([info](http://www.maximumfun.org/shows/stop-podcasting-yourself))**

- **Rating:** 3/3 
- Frequency: weekly
- Duration: 60 minutes
- Content: occasional strong language and adult themes

*SPY* is my favourite weekly podcast. Canadian comedians [Graham Clark](http://grahamclark.com/) and [Dave Shumka](http://t.co/kjtFZOvKZW) interview fellow comedians. More than once I’ve made people on the bus stare because I get myself into a laughing fit. I can’t recommend this one enough.

**![package_favorite](/images/package_favorite.png) NPR’s [Wait Wait…Don’t Tell Me!](http://www.npr.org/rss/podcast.php?id=35) ([info](http://www.npr.org/programs/wait-wait-dont-tell-me/))**

- **Rating:** 3/3 
- Frequency: weekly
- Duration: 1 hour
- Content: no strong language or disturbing themes

NPR’s weekly quiz show about current news and events. I always enjoy it.

**[We Have Concerns](http://simplecast.fm/podcasts/1041/rss) ([info](http://www.wehaveconcerns.com/))**

- **Rating:** 2/3 
- Frequency: 2–3 times a week
- Duration: 20 minutes
- Content: frequent strong language

This is a new podcast for me. [Anthony Carboni](http://anthonycarboni.com/) and [Jeff Cannata](http://jeffcannata.com/) pick some story out of the current news (often science related) and discuss it.

**[Welcome to Night Vale](http://nightvale.libsyn.com/rss) ([info](http://commonplacebooks.com/))**

- **Rating:** 3/3 
- Frequency: twice monthly
- Duration: 30 minutes
- Content: no offensive language, potentially frightening content

This is a podcast unlike any you’ve heard before. Think H.P. Lovecraft + comedy. You have to listen to it to understand. Very enjoyable.
