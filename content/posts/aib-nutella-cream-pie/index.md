Original recipe: <http://makinglifedelicious.com/2011/02/05/happy-5th-world-nutella-day-nutella-cream-pie/>

The recipe was straightforward and seemed to work out really well. It wasnâ€™t too cheese cakey, and the toasted hazelnuts of course taste great. I used a store-bought Oreo crust. I under baked it a little bit, but it was still tasty. The topping recipe made way too much whipped cream, and you really should put the topping on just before serving. After making so many pure chocolate desserts lately, the hazelnut was a nice change.

Actual yield: 1 pie

Verdict: Pretty good
