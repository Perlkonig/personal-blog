My name is Aaron Dalton. I have a BA (Hon.) and an MA in musicology from the University of Calgary. My area of focus was sixteenth-century Italian secular vocal music. I can speak, read, and write English, French, and Italian. More information on my academic work can be found on [my Academia.edu page](http://ucalgary.academia.edu/AaronDalton). I also discuss my thesis on [my master’s thesis page](./masters-thesis).

I am a professional editor and typesetter, with expertise in music editing and typesetting. I am an active member of [the Editors’ Association of Canada](http://editors.ca). I’m currently an editor for [the Alberta Energy Regulator](http://www.aer.ca) (the successor to the Energy Resource Conservation Board of Alberta) in Calgary, Alberta.
